# Introduction

According to The Joint Commission, medication names should not be abbreviated as misinterpretation may lead to administration of incorrect medication. Computerized order entry use eliminates this problem for orders, but clinical notes and clinical narrative are still flawed with abbreviations.


# Objectives

Identify abbreviated medication names in clinical narrative, using Natural Language Processing, as a first step towards elimination

# Methods

Retrospective chart review of pediatric ED consult notes at a tertiary pediatric center in 2019. We targeted consult notes due to potential differences in expertise between the documenting and reading providers.

Abbreviated, misspelled and true medication names were identified using 2 Natural Language Processing methods: 

1) named-entity recognition (NER) using a pre-trained model called MED7

2) Regular Expressions (RegEx) used to identify strings likely to be medications given surrounding text context

# Results

There were 29,877 consult notes available for review. We narrowed the corpus of documents to services more likely to prescribe medication (endocrinology, cardiology, neurology) and eliminated those services where medication treatment is a smaller part of their practice (orthopedics, urology) leaving 16,010 notes for review.

We identified 8,288 unique medication terms using NER and 2,671 using RegEx. The union of the two lists of medications had 9,541 unique medication terms. After cross referencing against RxNorm and NDCD 7,248 unique medication terms remained. After reviewing all terms occurring 2 or more times, a subset of terms, which were identified by an author as likely abbreviated medication names, was curated and is presented with frequency counts in Table 1.

# Conclusions

With natural language processing tools we can create libraries of abbreviated medication names. Future studies should include domain-expert champions to help interpret domain-specific expressions. These libraries should be incorporated into documentation tools within electronic medical records.
